I've always been fascinated by Rambo. Killed wild boar using a sharpened piece of wood. Single-handedly destroyed a platoon using knife, SMG, and exploding arrow. He masters all ins and outs of tools and terrains. He has passed 10000 hours. His work-life balance is pretty much nonexistent.

I want to be Rambo too.

I spent my highschool and early college watching movies about ultra-buff one-man army killer lone wolves. Rambo, Braddock, McClane, Riggs, Kersey, you name it. It's captivating to see someone highly proficient in their art single-handedly solve a complex problem. That's the closest someone can be to a superhuman. Although the real world doesn't work that way, it set the bar of proficiency to me.

#### ....

My first supervisor after college was highly proficient in database and networking. He let me explore those and after a few months I was assigned to lead a project. Then he sort of changed from supervisor to advisor. He advised me on how to be ready for spikes and stuffs. He challenged me when I used shortcut and not a proper way to handle a case. 

It was very relieving to have a fallback. To have someone to ask for advice when you done screw up. And his proficiency was "only" in stuffs that made up half of the project. There are other things that I needed to figure out. But it was okay because I knew there was someone to guide me when I made a mess of some parts.

Imagine if there's someone in your team that understand the magic behind the whole stack. S/he'll be able to advise, guide, or even spoonfeed the team. Even without hands-on involvement, s/he'll help the team by giving a sense of security. In a critical moment, s/he will show people how to fight back and destroy the evil boss bug with tired eyes and drooping mouth. The Rambo of your team.

Rambo is not a senior officer nor a leader. He is a guy with mastery over his craft. He understands why bomb works and where to plant that for maximum death toll. The combination of theoretical and practical knowledge is what makes him lethal. His knowledge has breadth of generalist and depth of specialist.

I think everyone should try to be Rambo.
