I am a programmer that's lucky enough to be surrounded by mathematicians and statisticians early on my career. This has piqued my interest in software engineering, computer science, statistics, and their intersection, in which exists a mythical race who knows how to set up a highly available pipeline, prepare data, fine-tune model, and implement production-grade algorithms.

This is a place to "publish" my notes, rants, and alternative facts on the IT computer thingies. Hopefully no one will hold me responsible for anything here forever and ever amen.
