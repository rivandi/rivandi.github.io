This is my place to store notes and rants about the IT computer thingies. The name `overdue optimization` itself doesn't mean anything but cheap attempt to look smart by antagonizing Don Knuth.

Below is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riyadrivandi) description. It has a lot of buzzwords. It is good for SEO.

> After realizing that watching YouTube in bed all day is not a sustainable career choice, I tried to code and gradually grew into it. Then I started freelancing around 2013, doing web development or algorithm implementation which are fundamentals for my current works.

To be honest, I had financial problem.

> I particularly enjoy increasing accuracy and decreasing response time. I aspire to be intersection of data science and data engineering.

Don't even know what that means.

> My favorite responsibility is learning technology or theory that helps product delivery, and creating its proof of concept. Be it related to high-availability, software performance, machine learning, data storage, or open source in general, I'm happy to explore, share, and discuss (well, except for visual stuffs).

I can't program HTML and CSS.

> After throwing buzzwords around office, I go back hiding in my bedroom then dabble on whatever I find interesting or just lay in bed doing nothing for hours.

Actually I just want to lay in my bed, browse the net, and eat stuffs everyday.
